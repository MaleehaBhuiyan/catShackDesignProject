          <h2> Meet Sylvester</h2>
          <br/>
          Meet this absolutely amazing kitty named Sylvester! His story is truly miraculous. He was found on the size of the road lying there, almost dead. He hadn’t been hit by a car, but was in fact starved almost to death. He was obviously social and not a feral kitty- but somehow people had left him outside... what makes this terribly tragic is that he is blind.
          No one could believe that he had survived he way he did, and not only did he survive, but he has the absolute sweetest personality. His first stop was the vets where he was given fluids and was nursed back to health. He was tested for fiv/felv and was negative, and had all of his medical work completed! He is estimated to be about 3-4 years old, and he is now absolutely thriving! He is in a foster home where he lives with other kitties as well as dogs and he is fantastic with all of them! He is the absolute sweetest boy and he loves to be with people! He adores purring for head scratches! Even though he cannot see he will put in the work to navigate where you are so he can be as close to you as possible! He does not climb (cat trees or furniture), though he is able to navigate well through his foster home navigating using the walls and memorizing hallways and spaces. He navigates the house so we and just needs to know where his food, water and litter box and he will be happy!!! (Oh, and of course, you!!). He has been a litter box pro and never missed! He loves catnip and scratch posts! His favorite thing, and maybe our favorite thing about him!!! Is that he is an amazing cuddler!! So sweet and grateful to be close and to connect with you!!
          He is looking for a wonderfully sweet, indoor only home where people are super loving!! He will be great with any animals, and humans- he just wants lots of love and a family who will cherish him for life:) if you would love to make this amazing guys dreams come true, please visit our website and submit an application for adoption today! www.greatdivideanimalrescue.org
